# RPI-Rover
This is is able to use all 4 wheels while showing the video feed from the camera. Makes a camera useful.

Uses Pulse width modulation for motor speed control, open cv for picking images, and GPIO to connect to the electronic.
I used to use this to explore my house from the little buggy here.
